## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This web app brings the excitement of the IPL auction to your college. Build your dream team through strategic bidding and budget management, all within a user-friendly online platform.

Key Features:
* Grouped Players: Focus on team composition by bidding on pre-defined player groups consisting of a batsman, bowler, and wicket-keeper/all-rounder. This ensures a well-balanced team and adds a layer of strategy to the auction process.
* Skill-Based Budget Allocation: Take a quick test to determine your team's starting budget. This test assesses your cricket knowledge and rewards strategic thinking, making the auction even more engaging.
* Real-Time Budget Tracking: Every bid placed is automatically deducted from your team's remaining budget, keeping you constantly aware of your spending power and adding a realistic element to the auction experience.
* Dynamic Leaderboard: Stay on top of the competition with a continuously updated leaderboard. Track your team's remaining budget and compare it to others to strategize your next move and emerge victorious.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Step into the shoes of an IPL team owner with these easy-to-follow steps:

1. Team Up: gather your friends and form a team to strategize the auction together, manually upload the CSV file in database.

2. Test Your Cricket Knowledge: Take the budget allocation test designed to assess your cricketing expertise. This test will determine your team's starting budget for the auction.

3. Bidding Frenzy: The auction begins! Browse through the player groups (batsman, bowler, wicket-keeper/all-rounder) and place your bids strategically. Remember, every bid you place is automatically deducted from your remaining budget, so choose wisely!

4. Track Your Progress: Keep an eye on the dynamic leaderboard that constantly updates team standings based on their remaining budget or other criteria defined in your app (e.g., total player value acquired). Use this information to adjust your bidding strategy and stay ahead of the competition.
